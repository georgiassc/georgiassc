<h1 align="left">Hey ðŸ‘‹ What's up?</h1>

###

<p align="left">My name is Georgia Cardoso and I am 23 years old, currently living in Porto, Portugal. Throughout my academic journey, I have discovered the immense potential of technology to transform the way we live and work. I am currently expanding my horizons at ISCAP, where I am pursuing a Master's in Electronic Business with a focus on Data Analysis with skills in tools like SQL, Power BI, and Excel.

I am eager to connect with professionals who share this passion for technology and the impact of data on business. If you are looking for a motivated and dedicated individual to join your Data Analysis team, I would love to chat! Please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn.</p>
